The process took 2 weeks –interviewed at Goldman Sachs.</p><p>Interview Details</p><p>The interviewing process began at my university career center and career fair. If your resume made it passed the screening process then you were invited for on-campus interviews.

On-Campus Interviews:
Met with 2 interviewers for 30 minutes each back-to-back. One of the interviews was entirely resume based. This is a very important aspect to understand while going into a technical interview. The only thing you can control in its entirety is what you say you know by putting it on your resume. I was asked java questions, classes. I was asked about Ocaml (which I had on my resume). Everything was straight forward. Spent most of my time talking about one of my projects. Resume-based interviews prevent lying, if you don't know something your interviewer will keep asking you more in-depth questions until you sound like a fool. (not speaking from experience, but absolutely will happen if you choose to BS an answer instead of saying you don't know). The second interview was designing an algorithm to plan a busy executives schedule. They really just want to see how you think about solving this type of problem. Just know how to be logical and VERBOSE. They need to know what you're thinking at all times to know you aren't stumped.

A week after the on-campus interviews finished I was invited to their superday at their Jersey City office. This was an amazing experience. All expenses were paid from the getting to the airport, my flight, my food, and the 5-star hotel they choose to put you in. It was calming, just what I needed to do well. This year they changed the superday interviewing structure, as I'm sure you've read, in the past interviewees could have as many as 9 interviews with 3 different sub-divisions of tech in one day. This year they revamped the system to make it more efficient for everyone, interviewers and interviewees. Everyone has two back-to-back interviews, each are 45 minutes. Both interviews have 2 interviewers from differing backgrounds. Remember, I am only speaking from my own experiences here, but it seemed like the first interview was more resume-based. They asked me to talk about myself and my keystone project (rubik's cube solving robot). They asked about a time I had to optimize code, I talked about the sieve of Eratosthenes. All standard OOD questions, inheritance. One interesting questions was what happens when you type a website into a browser. My interviewers were writing all over my resume taking notes, both good and bad.
The second interview was with two more individuals and they didn't look at my resume. Asked me all questions judging how I think. How would you calculate the exact amount of manholes in manhattan? How would you design a tetris videogame in java? Tell us about your rubik's cube algorithm.

All in all it was an interesting type of technical interview, no coding questions at all (for me). I proved quickly that easy technical questions and definitions weren't going to stump me so they wanted to see how and what I was thinking.

53	Application DetailsI applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks –interviewed at Goldman Sachs.Interview DetailsI was contacted by a Goldman Sachs internal recruiter who had a position that I was interested in. She forwarded my resume to another recruiter who approved it and sent it over to the hiring team. It was also approved by the hiring team and they brought me in for 4 initial interviews with members of the CMO team. It was 4 interviews with 4 different individuals each lasting 30 minutes each. The interviews were fairly straight forward nothing really too tricky. I was then invited back a few days later for 4 more interviews with 4 senior members of the team including two VPs. After these interviews I was scheduled to have a call with HR. This call was scheduled and then rescheduled and then cancelled. I was later called by one of the aforementioned recruiters and told that "Due to budget constraints they would not be filling the position this year". I don't know if this was just being nice or it is actually the true story. Anyway it struck me as extremely unprofessional to bring me into 8 separate interviews for a position they never intended on filling. It was an interesting process with Goldman Sachs but I was not happy with the end result and I doubt I will look for opportunities inside the company again.Interview Questions		Why Goldman Sachs?
