title: "Volunteer Teaching or Not"

I have been thinking of teaching. I have casually tutored but I have not committed to any long-term teaching role. My mom went for a STEM education program focused on teaching in college, yet I decided I would not be a teacher since 5 years old.

Education is completely different in United States. I have only attended private schools and I am aware of the big variation among public school education quality. One day I was listening to <a ref="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/">Software Engineering Daily podcast</a> and that episode was sponsored by TEALS. When I arrived at my apartment, a mail promoting TEALS program was lying there. What a coincident!

Most of the schools have well-equipped teachers who know the materials and their students way better than me. As a TA, what volunteers can do is to do some fun demonstrations of technology and tools. TEALS offers volunteers general pedagogical training, and our role is to charm the students with the beauty of Mathematics and CS, hoping that they get the wow moment like I had encountered in my school life <a ref="https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/127714217180/pixar-in-a-box-the-math-behind-the-movies">Pixar in a Box: the math behind the movies</a>.
