title: "Volunteer Teaching or Not"

I have been thinking of volunteering teaching for a while. I have casually tutored Mandarin, SAT Math, and college intro level mathematics classes. However, I have nevered committed to any long-term teaching role. Quite ironically, my mom went for a STEM education program focused on teaching in college, and I decided I would not be a teacher or a doctor since 5 years old.

Education is completely different in United States. I have only attended private schools and I am awared of the quality of public school education. One day I was listening to <a ref="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/">Software Engineering Daily podcast</a> on my way home and the episode on that day was sponsored by TEALS. When I arrived at my apartment, a mail promoting TEALS program was lying there. What a coincident!

Most of the schools have well-equipped teachers who know the materials and their students way better than me. As a TA, is to do some fun demonstrations of technology and tools. My goal would be introducing the ideas from Math Behind Pixar on Khan Academy, and charm the students with the beauty of Math and CS. This is challenging, I wish I had spent more time in a teaching role back in school. TEALS offers training to certain extent, and following Khan's videos is a must. Afterall, no one can deny Sal Khan's charm.
