Matt and I had a conversation while waiting for our tennis court, about the mindset many software engineers at large corporations have. Many of them are excellent coders, but lack the big picture of designing a user-friendly system without product managers' assistance. 

I also came cross Stitch Fix's blog, a company that has a data science team of 80 and zero data engineer. Everyone is responsible for the building and maintaining of the data pipelines. Continuous integration and deployement is extremely valuable and full-stack data scientists is defintely the future as the data science tools keep evolving. This inspires me to work on my engineering skills.
