After three months of training and preparation since my previous post, I landed a TA position at Hillsdale High for Introduction to Computer Science. The more I teach, the more I realize the bubble I lived in.

I am an OK tech writer in Chinese. I get invites writing about a variety of topics, from data science and concensus algorithems to economics every now and then. Although my passion is all about graphics and motions, I find communication through words to be the most powerful and truly deeply creative. It is not surprising to find writing both thought-provoking and demanding after 10 years of ESL education.
